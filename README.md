# Thiện Lê - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About me
My name is Thiện Lê, and I am a career changer passionate about data analytics. With a background in Marketing and Management, I recently completed my MBA at Western Sydney University, where I discovered my love for data analytics, inspiring my transition into this field. 

A quick overview of my career path:
- 2020: Marketing Executive at a 3D printing startup. 
- 2022: Media trainee at a media corporation
- 2023-Present: MBA student and IELTS teacher (this provides me the time I need to complete the MBA course and the career changing program).
 
In my previous role as a marketing executive at a 3D printing company, I was responsible for researching and developing a new helpdesk system that was not only cost-effective but also data-driven. This project saved the company over 40% in costs. I successfully implemented the system, collaborating with various departments to ensure its seamless integration. My duties included weekly data extraction to analyze customer sentiment, address pressing issues, and evaluate customer agent performance—critical insights that informed our decision-making process.

During my MBA, I took a course called Business Analytics in Practice, where I had the opportunity to work on a research project for an NGO focused on raising awareness for breast cancer patients. This experience, alongside the motivation from my peers, solidified my desire to switch to a data analyst career.

To prepare for this transition, I joined an intensive training program for data analysts, where I honed my skills in essential tools such as SQL, Python, Power BI, and machine learning. I’ve completed several projects that serve as a portfolio to demonstrate my capabilities in this field.

To address this challenge, our initiative focuses on predicting churned users and offering strategic promotions to re-engage them. By understanding the factors that lead to churn, we can not only recover lost revenue but also enhance customer relationships and foster loyalty.
